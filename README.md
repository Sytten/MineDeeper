MineDeeper
==========
In MineDeeper, you control a driller-robot who is on an unknown planet, trying to find some alien artifacts.
You have to dig to collect resources that you can sell to gain money. With that money, you can buy fuel, upgrades
or you can repair your robot. If you run out of fuel or life, your robot explodes and you have to restart a new game.

You can get the lastest build version (for windows only for now) here: http://tinyurl.com/cffdpm9.
You can also build build your own version if you want, you just have to download the source
(don`t forget to link SFML and SFGUI). The only problem if it's not in windows his the ressource file
for the icon. I'll try to do a more portable way in the futur.
