MineDeeper
==========

In MineDeeper, you control a driller-robot who is on an unknown planet, trying to find some alien artifacts.
You have to dig to collect resources that you can sell to gain money. With that money, you can buy fuel, upgrades
or you can repair your robot. If you run out of fuel or life, your robot explodes and you have to restart a new game.

Download

You can get the lastest build version (for windows only for now) in the corresponding section.
If you download the game for the first time, you`ll have to download the zip file with dependencies, but next
time you can download zip file without the depencies except if I make a big update (I'll be written).
You can also build build your own version if you want, you just have to download the source
(don`t forget to link SFML and SFGUI).
